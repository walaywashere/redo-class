# Testing Guide - Class 11-Newton Frontend

This guide will help you test the frontend application in different scenarios.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Test Without Backend (Mock Data Mode)

The application is configured to automatically use mock data when no Sanity backend is configured:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
cd newton-class-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will automatically detect that no Sanity backend is configured and use mock data.

### 2. Development Notice

When running without a backend, you'll see a yellow notice banner at the top of each page:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Development Mode: Using mock data. Configure NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID to connect to your Sanity backend.
```

This is normal and expected behavior when testing without Sanity.
